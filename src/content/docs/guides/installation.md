To install Kilt, you'll have to get some mods that Kilt requires on top of Kilt.

You can install **[Kilt Nightly](https://nightly.link/KiltMC/Kilt/workflows/gradle/version%2F1.20.1/Kilt%20Build%20JARs.zip) or a [release version of Kilt here.](https://modrinth.com/mod/kilt/versions)** When picking the version, Kilt's versioning is v(MC).x, So it would be v20.1.0. for the first version of 1.20.1. <br>
You can then put Kilt into your mods folder, and carry onto the rest of the guide.

The mods required to install Kilt are:
- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/versions?g=1.20.1)
- [Fabric Language Kotlin](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-language-kotlin/versions?g=1.20.1)
- [Forge Config API Port](https://modrinth.com/mod/forge-config-api-port/versions?g=1.20.1)
- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium/versions?g=1.20.1&l=fabric)
- [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium/versions?g=1.20.1)

We also recommend getting [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/versions?g=1.20.1) to allow editing of some mod configs in-game, on top of seeing if the mod loaded without checking logs.

Now that you have all required mods, along with Kilt installed, install any version compatible Forge / NeoForge mod directly into the mods folder. <br>

Launch the game.


All done! Kilt will now start making Neo/Forge mods run on Fabric automatically.
