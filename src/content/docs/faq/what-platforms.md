description: Information about the platforms that Kilt supports.

Almost any platform. Some platforms, such as [PojavLauncher derivatives](https://github.com/KiltMC/Kilt/issues/230) or others that do weird things when launching the game will crash immediately. Some platforms which use modpacks, for instance [QCXR](https://questcraft.org/), may also cause issues with Kilt, or other Forge mods.
