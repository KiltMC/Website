Check out the [issues page](https://github.com/KiltMC/Kilt/issues) or the wiki's [modlist](../mods.mdx). If a mod does not exist in the list or was closed, it may work! If a mod crashes or has unintended behavior, make an [issue](https://github.com/KiltMC/Kilt/issues) using the main page's [guide](https://github.com/KiltMC/Kilt/wiki#need-help) if an issue doesn't already exist. **__Do not report any issues to the original mod developers, we will do that ourselves if we need to.__**
