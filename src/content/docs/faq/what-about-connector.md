What about it?

Connector's aim is to have Fabric mods on (Neo)Forge, while Kilt aims to have (Neo)Forge mods on Fabric. Isn't it reasonable to just have both?

Kilt is not compatible with Connector, and using it in Kilt will cause Kilt to not load Connector by design. Additionally, any Connector addons will not work in Kilt.
