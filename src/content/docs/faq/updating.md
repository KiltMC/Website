title: What about updating/backporting to other versions of Minecraft?
description: Information about updating and backporting Kilt to other Minecraft versions.

While updates to newer versions are planned, Kilt is an incredibly large undertaking for only two people to work on. A NeoForge 1.21.1 build is currently in progress, however that is going to take some time. Afterwards, we would be able to move forward onto the latest version of Minecraft. Anything in-between and earlier is going to be unsupported, however someone else may take on that role instead as Kilt is an Open-Source project.
