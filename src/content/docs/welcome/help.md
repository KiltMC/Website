Need help because a mod you installed crashed or has unintentional behavior? You may make an [issue](https://github.com/KiltMC/Kilt/issues) or come to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/enGK2TymYJ).<br>
But first before you do that, you should follow these tips:
1. **Update** to the **latest version** of **Kilt** - The latest version may have fixes for your issue already.
2. **Isolate** the **Issue** - If possible, remove any mods that aren't needed. If you are unable to do that, please use the [Discord](https://discord.gg/enGK2TymYJ).
3. Get the **Crash Log** or **Latest Log** - Logs are important for determining your issue. A good service for log uploading is [mclogs](https://mclo.gs/).
4. On [GitHub](https://github.com/KiltMC/Kilt/issues), **follow the template**
